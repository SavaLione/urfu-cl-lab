## Second OpenCL lab
Task: Build an application that models and visualizes the behavior of particles on flat.

- [ ] Connection between OpenCL and OpenGL
- [ ] Per pixel coloring
    - [ ] Custom color
    - [ ] The count of particles is equal to the count of pixels, but the count of pixels must be multiple of 1024
- [ ] Interaction with application size
    - [ ] Interaction by computer mouse
    - [ ] Boom effect of colored particles
    - [ ] Each particle must have coordinates of the image pixel that was used for that specified particle
- [ ] Collision between particle and window borders
- [ ] Pixel shader
- [ ] Recreating the image
